# Vulgar

A Latin Vulgate Bible reader that breaks down each verse word-by-word so you can actually learn something while you read.

## What is this?

Ever tried reading the Vulgate and got lost three words in? Same. Vulgar shows you each Latin word in its own little bubble with a quick translation underneath. Hover over any word to get the full breakdown - dictionary form, part of speech, all the possible meanings, and grammar notes.

It's called Vulgar because let's be honest, nobody has time for "Biblia Sacra Vulgata" anymore.

## Features

- **Word bubbles** - Each word gets its own space with a basic translation below
- **Hover for details** - Grammar info, alternate meanings, lemma forms
- **Remembers your spot** - Uses localStorage so you can pick up where you left off
- **Dark theme** - Easy on the eyes, Darcula-style
- **Updated Latin spelling** - Uses J where appropriate (Jesus, not Iesus)

## Books included

**Old Testament:** Genesis 1-3, Exodus 20 (Ten Commandments), Psalms (1, 23, 51, 91, 150), Isaiah 53

**New Testament:** Matthew (1, 5-6, 28), John (1, 3, 14), Romans, 1 Corinthians 13 & 15, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, 1 Timothy, Hebrews, James, 1 Peter, 1 John, Revelation

## Usage

Just open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

Or if you want to be fancy:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then go to http://localhost:8000
```
